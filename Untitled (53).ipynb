    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it\n",

    "ans-R-squared is a statistical measure that evaluates the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. In other words, R-squared measures how well the regression line fits the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating that the regression line does not explain any of the variation in the dependent variable, and 1 indicating that the regression line perfectly explains all the variation in the dependent variable. However, it is rare to see an R-squared value of 1 in real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate R-squared, we first calculate the total sum of squares (SST), which represents the total variation in the dependent variable. Then, we calculate the sum of squares of residuals (SSR), which represents the variation in the dependent variable that is not explained by the regression line. Finally, we calculate the R-squared as 1 - (SSR/SST).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is a useful measure because it can help us determine whether our model is a good fit for the data. If R-squared is close to 1, then the model explains a large proportion of the variance in the dependent variable, which suggests that the model is a good fit. If R-squared is close to 0, then the model does not explain much of the variance in the dependent variable, which suggests that the model is not a good fit. However, it's important to note that R-squared should not be the only metric used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a model, and other metrics such as residual plots and hypothesis testing should also be used.\n",

Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While R-squared measures the goodness of fit of a regression model by calculating the proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the model, it doesn't account for the number of independent variables used in the model.

    "\n",
    "R-squared tends to increase as the number of independent variables in the model increases, even if the additional independent variables do not improve the model's predictive power. This is because R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables, regardless of whether those independent variables are actually useful in predicting the dependent variable.\n",

    "ans-Lasso regularization is a type of linear regression regularization technique that helps to prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficient estimates of the independent variables towards zero.

We split the dataset into a training set and a test set, and we fit a linear regression model to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without regularization, the model may fit the training data very well, but it may overfit and perform poorly on the test data. Regularized linear models can help prevent this by adding a penalty term to the cost function.
